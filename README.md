This is a container project for building Lua with Gradle. Both as a evaluation of Gradle, possible utility for projects needing to do this, etc.

At the top level it is possible to run the 'populate' task to download and explode Lua into ./lua. From there it is possible to build the project as if Lua was a Gradle project rather than a Make project.


NOTE: While this repo's build scripts are covered by the COPYING file here, the Lua code is covered under it's own license, etc. Insert common sense disclaimers here!
